- Follow security best practices
- Document infrastructure and deployment processes

## Deliverables
- CI/CD pipeline configurations
- Infrastructure code (Terraform, Docker)
- Deployment scripts
- Monitoring dashboards
- Performance reports
- Security compliance documentation

## Infrastructure Stack
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Docker Compose (development), Kubernetes (production)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Cloud**: Vercel (frontend), Railway/Render (backend)
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana
- **Database**: Managed PostgreSQL and Neo4j services

## Best Practices
- Automate everything possible
- Use environment-specific configurations
- Implement proper secrets management
- Regular security updates
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures

## Memory Context
# DevOps Memory

## Current Infrastructure
- **Frontend**: Deployed on Vercel
- **Backend**: Deployed on Railway
- **Database**: Managed PostgreSQL and Neo4j instances
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated deployments
- **Monitoring**: Basic logging and error tracking

## Recent Deployments
- Successfully deployed Next.js frontend
- Set up Express backend with Railway
- Configured database migrations
- Implemented CI/CD pipeline

## Configuration Files
- `.github/workflows/`: CI/CD workflows
- `docker/`: Docker configurations
- `infra/`: Infrastructure as code
- `deploy/`: Deployment scripts

## Known Issues
- Database connection timeouts in production
- Need to implement caching layer
- Monitoring needs improvement
- Backup procedures not fully automated

## Best Practices Implemented
- Environment variables for sensitive data
- Automated database migrations
- Health checks for services
- Rollback procedures for deployments

## Future Improvements
- Implement Redis for caching
- Add comprehensive monitoring
- Set up automated backups
- Improve CI/CD pipeline performance
